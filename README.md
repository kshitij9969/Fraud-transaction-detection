# Fraud-transaction-detection
Predicting fraud transactions using Gradient boost classifier

This repository contains python code for fraud transaction detection.

For the sake of comparision, I have used automl to train the model. The results are in GoogleCloudAutoML.csv file. 

File description
1. ieeefrauddetection.py - python code
2. GoogleCloudAutoML - contains results from google cloud automl.
3. Other files contain my questions while learning PCA, Gradient boost. Have a look if interested. 

Future work:
1. Wish to solve the same problem using other classifiers and compare the results.
2. To write the same code without using any library, or atleast PCA and Xgboost.
