# Fraud-transaction-detection
Predicting fraud transactions using Gradient boost classifier

The problem is from a Kaggle competition - IEEE fraud transaction detection

You can download the dataset from here:

https://www.kaggle.com/c/14242/download-all

This repository contains python code for fraud transaction detection.

For the sake of comparision, I have used automl to train the model. The results are in AutoML_final.csv file. 

File description
1. ieeefrauddetection.py - python code
2. AutoML_final - contains results from google cloud automl.
3. Kaggle_Submission - contains results from XGBoost Classifier

Future work:
1. Wish to solve the same problem using other classifiers and compare the results.
2. To write the same code without using any library, or atleast PCA and Xgboost.
