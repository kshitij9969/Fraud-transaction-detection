1. Does reducing dimensions affect the accuracy of the model?
2. Is there ever a case where we absolutely need to factor in a variable but PCA excludes it?
3. How does independence of variables impact performance? Why is it necessary to make variables independent?
4. What is the matrix called and how do we make it? What are its dimensions?
5. How do we break down the matrix into two components?
